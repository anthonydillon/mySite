					<h3><a href="http://www.danandlisa.co.uk" target="_blank">Dan and Lisa`s Wedding Website</a></h3>

					<p>
						This was my very first attempt at designing and building a website and I must say that im quite proud of it.
					</p>

					<h3>P.P.Diver Plastering (no longer active)</h3>

					<p>
						My second attempt at creating a website. This was for a close friend of mine.
						The colours were chosen because they were the colour of his buisness card.

					<h3>Hadrian Academy(Not Active)</h3>


					<img src="images/hadrianss.jpg">

					<p>
						This site was for a school where a friend of mine works. They were looking for ways to improve the current site that is built in wordpress, so I decided that I would take on this project as practice. In reality a site built from scratch that needs constant updating would be unrealistic and as I was unfamiliar with wordpress it was never going to get beyond my computer but was a valuable learning experience.
